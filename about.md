# :wave: Who am I ?

Hi, I'm Martin TOUZOT !

Currently working as an image processing engineer, and when I'm not watching a **movie** at [Le Grand Rex](https://www.legrandrex.com/), I love :
* reading **thrillers** :books:,
* playing **board games** :game_die: with friends
* **running** :runner: to take on personal challenges
  * 10km : Corrida de Noël d'Issy-Les-Moulineaux (2019, 2022) & few others,
  * Half-marathon : Lyon (2019) & Paris (2021, 2022, 2023),
  * Marathon : Paris (2021, 2022, 2023)

# :pushpin: About the blog

This blog main goal is to **document** and **share** some personal projects I'm working on. As a memo, it'll help me to track the evolution of **_some_** ideas I could have from their birth to their __most__ final shape!<br>

The main subjects you'll find here will focused on :
* **software programming** :computer:,
* **DIY** _(3D printing, craft,...)_ :construction:,
* **hardware** and **basic electronics** _(Raspberry Pi, Arduino)_ :electric_plug:,
* **to continue**...


# Some projects

 * _2018_ **Papibot Révillon** | [[:computer: Code](https://github.com/mtouzot/PapibotPi) & [:bird: Twitter account](https://twitter.com/papibotrevillon)] :skull:

    **PapibotPi** was a project made while I was a member of the [**ACoLab**](https://acolab.fr/), the **Clermont-Ferrand** FabLab. From a **Raspberry Pi Zero** under the pseudo of *Papibot Révillon*, this **bot posted quotes on Twitter**. Left for dead and buggy, this project was made in order, for me, to use **Python** and **SQL languages** (both where stuff I did not very well). With the acquisition of Twitter by **Elon Musk**, and the addition of the **paywall** for the API, maybe it will **stay dead** for some time.

 * _2021_ **GameBEye** | [[:computer: Code](https://github.com/mtouzot/GameBEye) & [:memo: Doc](https://mtouzot.github.io/GameBEye)] [**WIP**]

    **GameBEye** was made to keep playing with a **vintage object**, the **Game Boy Camera**. Released in the **late 90's** with **128x112 pixels** with no other value than one of **4 gray levels**, I though it would be fun to do some **image processing** with **Python** with theses pictures !

 * _2022_ **Project Simon** | [[:computer: GitHub organization](https://github.com/Project-Simon) & [:memo: Doc](https://project-simon.github.io)] [**WIP**]

    The **ProjectSimon** is the project I'm currently working on : an **open-source** and **DIY** motion picture **film scanner** for 35mm films based upon a **Raspberry Pi**, an **Adafruit Feather**, **3D printing**...,
